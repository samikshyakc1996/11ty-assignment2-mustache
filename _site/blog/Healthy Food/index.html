A baby born a minute ago is crying because he/she needs food right away. That just proves importance of food needn't to be learn, probably one of few other things such as breathing and blinking that requires no learning.
</p>
<p>
While The importance of food is unlimited for human life as like as it is important to other animals, it is very important to be mindful of what we are eating, why we are eating, when we are eating and How we are eating.
</p>
<p>
Yes every single question plays equally important role in our lives.

Food has a great influence on us and we need to practice a habit of proper diet considering the nutritious value of the food.</br>
our meals are mainly divided into three parts:
<ul>
<li> 1. Breakfast
</li>
</ul>
Breakfast is the first meal of the day. It can be kept light or be eaten until satiety. As you can burn the calories from breakfast the whole day, it really doesn't matter, and hence is merely a choice.</br>

</li>
</ul>
Lunch can be taken after 4 to 5 hrs after you had your breakfast. It is generally recommended to have a protein-rich lunch which includes meat, eggs in non-veg and beans, tofu in vegeterian dish.

Dinner is the last meal of the day. Therefore, it should generally be kept light and should be eaten as early as possible. It is not recommended to go to bed on full stomach. </br>
